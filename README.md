In this specific repository, there are various functions of PyAutoGUI and how to use them for mouse control, keyboard typing, and so on. If you want to see a project in practice, follow my whatsappbot.py.

Make sure that Python has permission to control the mouse. In some operating systems, like macOS, you may need to grant “Accessibility” permissions to the terminal or the IDE that you are using to run the Python script. On my macOS Sonoma 14.0, PyAutoGUI only works in the standard macOS terminal but not in VSCode.
