# Welcome to PyAutoGUI Project üëã

This repository contains various functions of PyAutoGUI and demonstrates how to use them for mouse control, keyboard typing, and so on. If you want to see a project in practice, follow the `whatsappbot.py`.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

```sh
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install pillow
```

Make sure that Python has permission to control the mouse. In some operating systems, like macOS, you may need to grant "Accessibility" permissions to the terminal or the IDE that you are using to run the Python script. On macOS Sonoma 14.0, PyAutoGUI only works in the standard macOS terminal but not in VSCode.
